# NAND2TETRIS

## About
Throughout this course a computer will be constructed from the bottom up. The process will start at the level of logic gates and will build from there. Each week, the exercises will add a new layer of abstraction to what was previously build. The end result will be a simulation of a modern computer that is able to run high level programming languages.

## Week 0
Course introduction and information.

## Week 1
In this week's project I started with a Nand gate and was able to create an array of more complex logic gates. This consist of all basic boolean gates as well as some composite gates such as Multiplexers and 16 bit boolean gates.

## Week 2
This week, I created more advanced chips based on the chips created last week. These chips included the half-adder, full-adder, 16-bit adder, 16-bit incrementer and arithmetic logic unit (ALU). This was very interesting as we now have chip capable of 16-bit binary addition based on what boils down to just Nand gates. Also the ALU, which is capable of more complicated mathematical functions, will form a core part of the Hack computer's CPU.
