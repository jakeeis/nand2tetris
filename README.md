# NAND2TETRIS

## About
Throughout this course a computer will be constructed from the bottom up. The process will start at the level of logic gates and will build from there. Each week, the exercises will add a new layer of abstraction to what was previously build. The end result will be a simulation of a modern computer that is able to run high level programming languages.
